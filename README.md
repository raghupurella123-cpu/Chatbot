I have created a ChatBOT project 
This project is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) based ChatBot created to help people by providing useful responses and basic guidance through conversation. The chatbot is designed using core OOPS principles to ensure clean structure, easy understanding, and code reusability. It is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how OOPS concepts are applied in real-world applications.

Objectives
The main objective of this project is to implement OOPS concepts in a practical way. It helps in understanding how classes and objects work together to build an interactive chatbot. The project also aims to improve problem-solving skills and logical thinking.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)
Platform: Command Line Interface

OOPS Concepts Implemented
Classes and Objects are used to define chatbot behavior.
Encapsulation is used to protect data and organize code.
Inheritance is used to reuse functionality.
Polymorphism allows methods to behave differently based on usage.
Abstraction helps in hiding internal implementation details.

Features
The chatbot interacts with users through text input.
It provides predefined responses to common questions.
The code structure is simple, modular, and easy to understand.
New features and responses can be added easily.

How to Run the Project
First, download or clone the project files.
Open the project folder in your system.
Run the main Python file using the Python interpreter.
Start interacting with the chatbot through the terminal.

Future Scope
This chatbot can be improved by adding artificial intelligence features.
Voice input and output can be integrated.
A graphical user interface or web interface can be developed.
Real-time data can be fetched using APIs.
